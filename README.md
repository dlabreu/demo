## Introduction

Ansible and Terraform are both widely used in the DevOps community for automation, configuration management, and infrastructure provisioning. While Ansible focuses on configuration management and application deployment, Terraform specializes in infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling you to provision and manage cloud resources with ease. By combining the strengths of Ansible and Terraform, you can achieve a seamless and efficient workflow for deploying and managing complex infrastructure environments.

This repository demonstrates the integration of Ansible with Terraform to automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure resources. It provides examples of provisioning infrastructure on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and then configuring those resources using Ansible playbooks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the examples and demos provided in this repository, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

- **Ansible**: Install Ansible on your local machine. You can refer to the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for installation instructions suitable for your operating system.

- **Cloud Provider Account**: Depending on the examples you want to run, you may need accounts with cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. Ensure that you have appropriate access and credentials to provision resources on these platforms.

- **Git**: You'll need Git installed to clone this repository and access the example configurations. Install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.
